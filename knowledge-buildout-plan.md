# Knowledge File Build-Out Plan

## Objective

To systematically create comprehensive and useful knowledge files across the project, enhancing documentation quality and developer productivity.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup

- **Define Template**: Create a standardized template for all knowledge files containing essential sections (Overview, Contents, Purpose, Key Components, Dependencies, Notes).
- **Automate Creation**: Use the existing system to ensure each directory has a skeleton knowledge file.

### Phase 2: Detailed Content Creation

- **Identify Key Directories**: Prioritize directories critical to the project's operation or those with the most complexity (e.g., `src/agents`, `src/utils`).
- **Assign Responsibilities**: Allocate specific directories to team members for expertise-driven content creation.
- **Research and Gather Information**: Review code, existing documentation, and requirements to build out each section.
  - **Overview**: Provide a brief description of the directory's purpose and role.
  - **Contents**: List files and subdirectories with descriptions.
  - **Purpose**: Define the directory's role in the project.
  - **Key Components**: Describe essential files/modules.
  - **Dependencies**: Outline relationships with other parts of the project.
  - **Notes**: Add any additional insights or warnings.

### Phase 3: Review and Collaborate

- **Peer Review**: Have team members review each other's contributions for accuracy and comprehensiveness.
- **Weekly Check-ins**: Schedule regular meetings to discuss progress and address any challenges.
- **Iterate**: Incorporate feedback and refine the content.

### Phase 4: Maintenance and Updates

- **Set Review Intervals**: Schedule periodic reviews to keep knowledge files up-to-date as the codebase evolves.
- **Automate Alerts**: Implement a system for alerting developers when related code changes might require documentation updates.

### Phase 5: Leverage AI and Tooling

- **AI Assistance**: Use AI agents to suggest possible enhancements or automations where feasible.
- **Integration with Tools**: Integrate with documentation tools for format validation and consistency checks.

## Success Metrics

- **Coverage**: Knowledge files exist for all major directories.
- **Usefulness**: Positive feedback from team members on the ease of finding information.
- **Completeness**: Each knowledge file is detailed and informative, following the template.
- **Timeliness**: Regular updates ensure alignment with the latest code changes.

## Tools and Resources

- **Interviews/Surveys**: Gather insights from developers who work with specific parts of the code.
- **Documentation Tools**: Explore tools that can aid in maintaining and visualizing documentation.

## Implementation Strategy

### Priority Order for Knowledge File Creation

1. **High Priority** (Core functionality)
   - `src/utils/` - Knowledge management utilities
   - `src/agents/` - AI agent definitions
   - Root directory - Project overview

2. **Medium Priority** (Supporting infrastructure)
   - Configuration files and build tools
   - Test directories

3. **Low Priority** (Generated or external)
   - Build output directories
   - Temporary folders

### Template Sections (Standardized)

Each knowledge file should contain:

```markdown
# [Directory Name]

## Overview

Brief description of the directory's purpose and role.

## Contents

### Files

- `filename.ext` - Description of what this file does

### Subdirectories

- `subdirectory/` - Description of what this subdirectory contains

## Purpose

Detailed explanation of the directory's role in the overall project.

## Key Components

List and describe important files or modules in this directory.

## Dependencies

List any dependencies or relationships with other parts of the project.

## Notes

Any additional notes, warnings, or important information.

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**
   - Review existing knowledge files against the template
   - Update high-priority directories with detailed content

2. **Short-term (Weeks 2-4)**
   - Complete medium-priority knowledge files
   - Establish review process with team

3. **Long-term (Ongoing)**
   - Implement maintenance schedule
   - Explore AI-assisted documentation tools
